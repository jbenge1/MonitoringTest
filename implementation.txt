I imagine that I will need to be checking the health of the application periodically.
    -To do this maybe have a separate method that is called from my main method in which we have a loop that will
constantly be checking the status of the application. so something like
    while(true)
    {
        do_check();
        sleep(minutes);
    }

    -TODO: research how I can have this separate method running in the background..

    --!!! Check out spring's @Scheduled annotaion !!!
        -This is what I want. It works exactly as I expect, and exactly as is necessary
